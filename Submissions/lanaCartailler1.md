#### Objective Section Responses

1. What is the dataset you chose? (include a link to the dataset)
   1. The dataset is [Indicators of Heart Disease](www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease/versions/2/data).
2. What is the focus question you are trying to answer with this dataset? Include whether this is a classification, clustering, or other type of problem.
   1. The goal of using this dataset is to predict the likelihood of getting heart disease based on 17 different clinical variables, such as age and physical activity. This is a neural network problem, which is a classification problem by extent.
3. What is your plan for cleaning this dataset? (you don't have to go into too much detail, just a general idea of what you are going to do)
   1. I will need to convert all the non-numerical data to numerical data through either one-hot encoding or binary encoding. Then, the continuous variables will need to be scaled, and the target variable will need to be converted to numerical values. The input data will also need to be converted to the float data type.
4. Any extra information you'd like to include.
   1. N/A
